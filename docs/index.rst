GreenLearning
=============

GreenLearning is a deep learning library based on Tensorflow for learning `Green's functions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function>`_ associated to systems of 1D linear `Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation>`_.

The library is maintained by `Nicolas Boull√© <https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/boulle/>`_. If you are interested in using it, do not hesitate to get in contact at ``boulle@maths.ox.ac.uk``.

Features
--------

- GreenLearning learns Green's functions and homogeneous solutions associated to 1D linear ODEs with deep learning.
- `Rational neural networks <https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/a3f390d88e4c41f2747bfa2f1b5f87db-Paper.pdf>`_ are implemented and used to increase the accuracy of the learned Green's functions.
- GreenLearning requires no hyperparameter tuning to successfully learn Green's functions.
- The neural networks can be created and trained easily with a few lines of code.
- It is simple to generate the training datasets with MATLAB scripts.
